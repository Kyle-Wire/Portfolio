                            Hi! My name is Kyle Wire as you've seen early and well, I hope you're here because you searched for me too. Anyway, I am an Urban Designer looking to change careers into a field with endless possibilities. I have a BS in Environmental Science and a M.Des in Sustainable Urban Enivironments.

                            It isn't exactly what I thought it would be, and I am ready for some new challenges and problems to solve! I've always been drawn to coding and my brain feels all warm when I'm working on it, which feels right? I have a big interest in learning more about Machine Learning and the future that is in store for that field, but I also love the design aspect of coding and all the possibilities that are possible with it.
                        </p>
